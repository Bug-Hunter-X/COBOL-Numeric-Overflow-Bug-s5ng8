This repository demonstrates a common numeric overflow bug in COBOL programs. The bug occurs when an attempt is made to store a value larger than the defined size of the numeric field. This can cause unexpected truncation or overflow, leading to incorrect results or program crashes. The solution provides a method to handle numeric overflow gracefully, preventing unexpected behaviour.
